## Chapter 2: Process Scheduling Algorithm
### Program1 : Write C program to implement FCFS CPU Scheduling Algorithm with the no’s of process , with their arrival time , burst time is input by user and find the average turn around time and average waiting time. Number Of process is p1,p2,p3 and their corresponding arrival time will be 0,1and 2 and their burst time will be 5,3,8.
